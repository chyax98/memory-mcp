## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Automated VS Code Setup**: One-command installation with automatic configuration
  - `npm run setup` command that handles install, build, link, and VS Code config
  - Automatic detection of VS Code stable and Insiders
  - Smart detection of `mcp.json` format (supports both `servers` and `mcpServers` properties)
  - Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
  - No manual configuration needed for VS Code users

- **Improved Build System**: Separated dev and release builds
  - `npm run build` - Fast development build (no version bump)
  - `npm run build:release` - Release build with automatic version bump
  - Prevents version spam during development
  - Cleaner version history

- **Time Range Search**: Filter memories by creation date
  - `daysAgo` parameter - Search memories from last N days (e.g., 7 for last week)
  - `startDate` parameter - Search memories created on or after a specific date
  - `endDate` parameter - Search memories created on or before a specific date
  - Works with content search, tag search, and combined queries
  - Supports both relative (daysAgo) and absolute (startDate/endDate) time filtering

- **Backup Statistics**: Memory stats now includes backup information when configured
  - Backup enabled status
  - Backup path location
  - Number of backup files
  - Minutes since last backup
  - Minutes until next backup
  
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Comprehensive README improvements
  - Performance metrics table with throughput
  - Cloud storage best practices integrated
  - Clear installation options (npm vs development)
  - Backup configuration examples
  - Real-world usage examples

## Migration Guide v1.x → v2.0

### Upgrading

No action required! Simply update to v2.0 and run as normal. The migration system will:

1. **Detect** old schema automatically
2. **Create** backup of your database
3. **Apply** migrations in a transaction
4. **Verify** data integrity
5. **Complete** in under 50ms

### What Changes

**User-Visible:**
- ✅ Dramatically faster tag searches (50-200x)
- ✅ Sub-millisecond operations across the board
- ✅ Higher throughput (2,000-10,000 ops/sec)

**Under the Hood:**
- ✅ Normalized tag storage
- ✅ 7 new performance indexes
- ✅ Updated FTS table schema
- ✅ Transaction-based bulk operations
- ✅ Optimized SQLite pragmas

**Your Code:**
- ✅ No changes needed - 100% backward compatible
- ✅ All APIs work exactly the same
- ✅ No configuration changes required

### Rollback

If you need to rollback (unlikely):

1. Stop the server
2. Find the backup file: `memory.db.backup-[timestamp]`
3. Restore: `cp memory.db.backup-[timestamp] memory.db`
4. Use v1.x version of the server

### Performance Expectations

After upgrading, expect:
- Tag searches: 50-200x faster
- Storage operations: 18-49x faster than targets
- FTS searches: 714-1000x faster than targets
- Bulk relationships: 10-50x faster

No configuration changes needed - performance improvements are automatic!
