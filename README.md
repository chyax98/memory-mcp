## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1️⃣ One-Command Setup

**From Source:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chrisribe/simple-memory-mcp.git
cd simple-memory-mcp
npm run setup
```

**Or from npm (when published):**
```bash
npm install -g simple-memory-mcp
```

That's it! The `setup` command automatically:
- ✅ Installs dependencies
- ✅ Builds TypeScript → JavaScript
- ✅ Links globally (makes `simple-memory` command available)
- ✅ Configures VS Code (both stable and Insiders)

> 💡 VS Code users: The setup automatically adds the MCP server to your `mcp.json` file. Just restart VS Code after setup!

### 2️⃣ For Other MCP Clients (Optional)

If you're using Claude Desktop or other MCP clients, add this to their config:

**Claude Desktop** (`claude_desktop_config.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "simple-memory-mcp": {
      "command": "simple-memory"
    }
  }
}
```

> 💡 **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`  
> 💡 **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

### 3️⃣ Start Using

Restart your MCP client and the `simple-memory-mcp` server will be available. The AI assistant can now:
- 🧠 Remember information across conversations
- 🔍 Search your stored memories
- 🏷️ Organize with tags

## 💻 Usage

### As MCP Server

The server exposes tools that your AI assistant can use directly. Once configured, your assistant will:

**🧠 Auto-Capture Mode** - Proactively store important information:
- Preferences you mention ("I prefer dark mode")
- Decisions you make ("Let's use PostgreSQL")
- Facts about people, projects, or tools
- Learnings and insights you discover

**📝 Manual Storage** - You can also explicitly ask:
- "Remember that I prefer dark mode"
- "Store this meeting summary with tags project and planning"
- "Search my memories for Python tips"
- "Show me all memories tagged with 'important'"

The assistant stores memories silently and retrieves them when relevant, creating a seamless conversation experience.

### Command Line Interface

You can also use the CLI directly:

```bash
# Store a memory
simple-memory store-memory --content "Your content here" --tags "tag1,tag2"

# Search by content
simple-memory search-memory --query "search term"

# Search by tags
simple-memory search-memory --tags "tag1,tag2"

# Search memories from last week
simple-memory search-memory --query "project" --days-ago 7

# Search memories from specific date range
simple-memory search-memory --start-date "2025-01-01" --end-date "2025-01-31"

# View statistics
simple-memory memory-stats

# Delete by tag
simple-memory delete-memory --tag "old-notes"
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `MEMORY_DB` | Database file path | `./memory.db` | `/home/user/memories.db` |
| `MEMORY_BACKUP_PATH` | Backup directory (optional) | None | `/home/user/backups` |
| `MEMORY_BACKUP_INTERVAL` | Minutes between backups | `0` (disabled) | `180` |
| `MEMORY_BACKUP_KEEP` | Number of backups to keep | `10` | `24` |
| `MEMORY_CLOUD_SAFE` | Cloud storage safe mode | `false` | `true` |
| `DEBUG` | Enable debug logging | `false` | `true` |

### Custom Database Location

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "simple-memory": {
      "command": "simple-memory",
      "env": {
        "MEMORY_DB": "/path/to/your/memory.db"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### With Automatic Backups

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "simple-memory": {
      "command": "simple-memory",
      "env": {
        "MEMORY_DB": "/home/user/memory.db",
        "MEMORY_BACKUP_PATH": "/home/user/OneDrive/MCP-Backups",
        "MEMORY_BACKUP_INTERVAL": "180",
        "MEMORY_BACKUP_KEEP": "24"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**💡 Backup Strategy:**
- **Lazy backups** - Only backs up after write operations
- **Throttled** - Won't backup again until interval passes
- **Efficient** - No wasted backups when idle

**⚠️ Cloud Storage Best Practices:**
- ✅ **Recommended**: Store database locally, backup to cloud (as shown above)
- ⚠️ **Not Recommended**: Store database directly in OneDrive/Dropbox
  - WAL mode creates 3 files that sync at different times → corruption risk
  - File locking conflicts cause "database locked" errors
  - 2-10x slower performance

**If you must store directly in cloud storage**, enable safe mode:
```json
{
  "env": {
    "MEMORY_DB": "/path/to/OneDrive/memory.db",
    "MEMORY_CLOUD_SAFE": "true"
  }
}
```
This uses DELETE journal mode instead of WAL (30-50% slower but safer).

### Multiple Database Instances

Run multiple instances for different contexts:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory-work": {
      "command": "simple-memory",
      "env": {
        "MEMORY_DB": "/path/to/work-memory.db"
      }
    },
    "memory-personal": {
      "command": "simple-memory",
      "env": {
        "MEMORY_DB": "/path/to/personal-memory.db"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 📝 Examples

### Real-World Usage with AI Assistants

Simple Memory shines when used with AI assistants through MCP. Here are real conversation flows:

#### 🎯 Example 1: Building Project Context Over Time

**Day 1:**
> **You:** "I'm starting a new project. It's a React app with TypeScript, using Vite for bundling. We'll deploy to Vercel."
> 
> **Assistant:** *Stores this with tags: `project`, `react`, `typescript`, `vite`, `vercel`*

**Day 3:**
> **You:** "What stack am I using for my project again?"
> 
> **Assistant:** *Searches memories and finds: "You're using React with TypeScript, Vite for bundling, and deploying to Vercel."*

**Week 2:**
> **You:** "We decided to add Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL for the database."
> 
> **Assistant:** *Stores this and auto-links to previous project memories*

**Week 4:**
> **You:** "Give me a summary of all my tech stack decisions."
> 
> **Assistant:** *Retrieves all related memories and provides complete context*

#### 💡 Example 2: Personal Knowledge Base

**Learning Session:**
> **You:** "Remember this: TypeScript generics allow type-safe reusable components. The syntax is `function name<T>(arg: T): T`"
> 
> **Assistant:** *Stores with tags: `typescript`, `generics`, `learning`*

> **You:** "Also note: Array.reduce() is perfect for transforming arrays into single values. Use it instead of forEach when accumulating."
> 
> **Assistant:** *Stores with tags: `javascript`, `arrays`, `patterns`*

**Later that week:**
> **You:** "What did I learn about TypeScript generics?"
> 
> **Assistant:** *Retrieves your note with the exact syntax example*

> **You:** "Show me all my JavaScript tips"
> 
> **Assistant:** *Searches tag `javascript` and finds all related notes*

#### 🔐 Example 3: Secure Information Storage

**Storing Credentials:**
> **You:** "Store this API key for the payment gateway: sk_live_abc123xyz"
> 
> **Assistant:** *Stores securely with tags: `api-key`, `payment`, `credentials`*

> **You:** "The database connection string is postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db"
> 
> **Assistant:** *Stores with tags: `credentials`, `database`, `connection-string`*

**Retrieval:**
> **You:** "What's my payment gateway API key?"
> 
> **Assistant:** *Searches memories: "Your payment gateway API key is sk_live_abc123xyz"*

> **You:** "Show me all my stored credentials"
> 
> **Assistant:** *Lists all memories tagged with `credentials`*

#### 📋 Example 4: Meeting Notes & Decisions

**After Team Meeting:**
> **You:** "Meeting notes: Team agreed on 2-week sprints starting Monday. Sprint planning on Mondays at 10am. Retrospectives on Fridays."
> 
> **Assistant:** *Stores with tags: `meeting`, `agile`, `team`, `schedule`*

> **You:** "Important decision: We're going with PostgreSQL instead of MongoDB for better transaction support."
> 
> **Assistant:** *Stores with tags: `decision`, `database`, `architecture`*

**Later:**
> **You:** "When are our sprint meetings?"
> 
> **Assistant:** *Retrieves schedule from meeting notes*

> **You:** "Why did we choose PostgreSQL?"
> 
> **Assistant:** *Finds decision and reasoning: "For better transaction support"*

#### 🚀 Example 5: Continuous Context Building

The real power comes from **persistent memory across all conversations**:

```
Session 1: Store project setup info
  ↓
Session 2: Assistant remembers and builds on it
  ↓
Session 5: Store API decisions
  ↓
Session 10: Assistant recalls everything - full context maintained
  ↓
Session 20: Complete project knowledge base available instantly
```

**This is impossible with standard chat sessions that lose context!**

### 🔧 CLI Usage (For Testing & Direct Access)

You can also use the CLI directly for testing or scripting:

```bash
# Store a memory
simple-memory store-memory \
  --content "PostgreSQL connection: postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb" \
  --tags "database,credentials"

# Search by content
simple-memory search-memory --query "PostgreSQL"

# Search by tags
simple-memory search-memory --tags "credentials"

# View statistics
simple-memory memory-stats

# Delete memories by tag
simple-memory delete-memory --tag "temporary"
```

**When to use CLI:**
- ✅ Testing the MCP server works
- ✅ Bulk operations or scripting
- ✅ Debugging or inspecting the database
- ✅ Manual backup before major changes

**Primary use case:** Let your AI assistant handle everything through natural conversation!
